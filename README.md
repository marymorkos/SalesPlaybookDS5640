**TASKS**:  
1. **Customer Segmentation**: Categorizes prospects based on company characteristics to enable targeted outreach using clustering algorithms (KMeans, DBSCAN) and exploratory data analysis
2. **Pipeline Progression Guide**: Provides stage-specific action recommendations to move deals forward, analyzing ticket and deals data to determine if all steps are necessary for successful deals and if training is always needed for upsell and new customers
3. **Deal Outcome Prediction**: Uses machine learning classification models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, Neural Network) to forecast deal success probability
4. **Implementation Handoff Optimization**: Streamlines transitions between sales and customer success teams
5. **Resource Allocation Recommendations**: Suggests appropriate resource levels based on customer segment and complexity, measuring complexity through metrics like total tickets needed, average resolution time, and analyzing if different customer segments require different implementation approaches
6. **Interactive Dashboard**: Presents actionable insights in a user-friendly interface built with Streamlit
7. **Automated Data Pipeline**: Keeps recommendations current with ETL frameworks (Pandas pipelines) and data cleaning scripts
Containerized Deployment: Ensures consistent environment setup using Docker, Docker Compose, and Kubernetes for containerization and deployment



#Summary of Tasks
**1. Customer Segmentation**
Goal: Group prospects into clusters based on characteristics (like company size, industry, or past behavior) to personalize marketing and sales strategies.

Techniques:

Clustering Algorithms:

KMeans: Groups similar customers into a fixed number of clusters.

DBSCAN: Detects clusters of varying shapes and densities, good for spotting outliers.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understand trends and patterns before clustering.

Outcome: Tailored outreach plans based on each segment's behavior or needs.



**2. Pipeline Progression Guide**
Goal: Identify which actions at each stage of the sales pipeline lead to successful deal closures.

Approach:

Analyze tickets and deals data to track progression.

Determine:

Which pipeline steps are essential for deal success.

Whether certain types of customers (like upsells or new clients) always need training or support.

Outcome: A playbook of recommended actions per stage to help sales reps push deals forward efficiently.



**3. Deal Outcome Prediction**
Goal: Predict whether a deal will close successfully.

Models Used:

Logistic Regression – Good for baseline performance.

Random Forest – Handles non-linearities and interactions well.

XGBoost – Highly accurate boosting algorithm.

Neural Network – Captures complex patterns (if you have lots of data).

Outcome: A probability score for each deal that helps prioritize efforts.



**4. Implementation Handoff Optimization**
Goal: Make the transition from Sales to Customer Success smoother after a deal closes.

What’s involved:

Analyze how handoffs currently happen.

Identify pain points (e.g., delays, miscommunication).

Propose solutions like handoff templates, checklists, or automated triggers.

Outcome: Faster onboarding, fewer dropped balls, better customer experience.



**5. Resource Allocation Recommendations**
Goal: Allocate resources (e.g., support staff, onboarding tools) based on customer needs.

Measured By:

Customer complexity:

Total number of tickets.

Average ticket resolution time.

Number of teams involved.

Compare complexity across customer segments.

Outcome: Guidance on how much support each type of customer needs (e.g., enterprise vs SMB).



**6. Interactive Dashboard**
Goal: Create a visual tool for decision-makers to interact with all the ML insights.

Tech Used:

Streamlit – A Python-based library to build fast, simple dashboards.

Features:

View segments and predicted outcomes.

Filter by region, deal size, sales rep, etc.

Actionable insights shown clearly for business users.



**7. Automated Data Pipeline**
Goal: Keep all your models and dashboards updated automatically.

Built With:

ETL using pandas and scheduled scripts.

Cleans data, applies transformations, and refreshes model inputs.

Outcome: No need for manual updates — recommendations stay fresh.



**8. Containerized Deployment**
Goal: Ensure your entire ML system runs smoothly across environments (local, dev, prod).

Tech Stack:

Docker – Packages code and dependencies.

Docker Compose – Runs multi-container apps.

Kubernetes – Scales and manages containers for deployment.

Outcome: Reliable, repeatable setup across machines and teams.
